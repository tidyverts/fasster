# fasster: Fast Additive Switching of Seasonality, Trend, and Exogenous Regressors

Implementation of the FASSTER (Forecasting with Additive Switching of
Seasonality, Trend, and Exogenous Regressors) model for forecasting time
series with multiple seasonal patterns. The model combines state space
methodology with a switching component in the observation equation to
allow flexible modeling of complex seasonal patterns, including
time-varying effects and multiple seasonalities.
