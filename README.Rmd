An implementation of the FASSTER (Forecasting with Additive Switching of Seasonality, Trend and Exogenous Regressors) model in R. This model is designed to capture patterns of multiple seasonality in a state space framework by using state switching. The *fasster* package prioritizes flexibility, computational speed and accuracy to provide convenient tools for modelling, predicting and understanding high frequency time-series.

## Model information

This model was developed in 2017 for an honours thesis, and the clearest description with examples of using fasster can be found in my useR! 2018 talk: [slides](https://slides.mitchelloharawild.com/user2018/), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YlboftSalY), [source](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/talk-user2018-fasster).

The model uses a forward filtering backward smoothing heuristic for estimating the initial states in the model. It is essentially an opinionated wrapper of the `{dlm}` package aimed at making it easier to specify a sophisticated model suitable for forecasting complex seasonal patterns.

## Installation

The **stable** version can be installed from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("fasster")
```

The **development** version can be installed from GitHub using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverts/fasster")
```

## Usage

### Model specification

*fasster* allows flexible model specification by allowing the user to specify the model structure with standard formula conventions.

```{r xreg, message=FALSE}
library(fasster)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tsibble)
library(fable)

lung_deaths <- as_tsibble(cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths), pivot_longer = FALSE)
fit <- lung_deaths |>
  model(fasster = FASSTER(fdeaths ~ mdeaths))
fit |> report()
```

Commonly used state space components can be added using the following convenience functions:

* `trend(n)` to include an n-th order polynomial
* `season(s)` to include a seasonal factor of frequency s
* `fourier(s, q)` to include seasonal fourier terms of frequency s with q harmonics
* `arma(ar, ma)` to include an ARMA term (where ar and ma are vectors of coefficients)
* Exogenous regressors can be added by referring to their name

For example, to create a model with trend and monthly seasonality, you can use:
```{r component}
fit <- as_tsibble(USAccDeaths) |> 
  model(fasster = FASSTER(value ~ trend(1) + fourier(12)))
fit |> report()
```

The interface for creating a FASSTER model introduces a new formula construct, `%S%`, known as the switch operator. This allows modelling of more complex patterns such as multiple seasonality by modelling the components for each group separately and switching between them.

```{r complex}
elec_tr <- tsibbledata::vic_elec |>
  filter(
    Time < lubridate::ymd("2012-03-01")
  ) |> 
  mutate(WorkDay = wday(Time) %in% 2:6 & !Holiday)

elec_fit <- elec_tr |>
  model(
    fasster = fasster(log(Demand) ~ 
      WorkDay %S% (fourier(48, 16) + trend(1)) + Temperature + I(Temperature^2)
    )
  )
```

### Decomposing

Fitted FASSTER models can be decomposed to provide a description of how the underlying states function. Decomposing a FASSTER model provides aggregates of its components such as trends and seasonalities.

These components can accessed from a fitted model using the `components()` function:
```{r decompose}
fit |> 
  components()
```

```{r decompose-complex}
elec_fit |>
  components()
```


The tools made available by *fasster* are designed to integrate seamlessly with the tidyverse of packages, enabling familiar data manipulation and visualisation capabilities.

### Forecasting
  
*fasster* conforms to the object structure from the *fable* package, allowing common visualisation and analysis tools to be applied on FASSTER models.
```{r forecast}
fit |> 
  forecast(h=24) |>
  autoplot(as_tsibble(USAccDeaths))
```

Future index values are automatically produced and used where necessary in the model specification. If additional information is required by the model (such as `WorkDay` and `Temperature`) they must be included in a `tsibble` of future values passed to `new_data`.

```{r complex_fc}
elec_ts <- tsibbledata::vic_elec |>
  filter(
    yearmonth(Time) == yearmonth("2012 Mar")
  ) |> 
  mutate(WorkDay = wday(Time) %in% 2:6 & !Holiday) |> 
  select(-Demand)
elec_fit |> 
  forecast(new_data = elec_ts) |> 
  autoplot(elec_tr)
```
