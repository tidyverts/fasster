Title: Fast Additive Switching of Seasonality, Trend, and Exogenous Regressors
Description: Implementation of the FASSTER (Forecasting with Additive Switching 
    of Seasonality, Trend, and Exogenous Regressors) model for forecasting time 
    series with multiple seasonal patterns. The model combines state space 
    methodology with a switching component in the observation equation to allow 
    flexible modeling of complex seasonal patterns, including time-varying 
    effects and multiple seasonalities.
